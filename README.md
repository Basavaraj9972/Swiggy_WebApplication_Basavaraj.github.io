Hello This is clone of Swiggy Web Application so
1)Extract This Project, I am used MySql Data Base so you need to create database name: `tapfoods`  
2)6 tables are ther so 
1. `user`,
2. 2.`restaurant`,
3.  3.`menu`,
4.  4.`order`,
5.  5.`orderitems`,
6.  `orderitems`.
A.So I added google drive link of database and all 6 table structure and data also just download file extract.
Google Drive databse link is : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15ZtyPCVnO4I4atmzG9OsIVQ3z1s6at7v?usp=sharing.
if allready database is present of `tapfoods` drop first then go to MYSQl WORKBENCH
then  go to menu bar in -> server option -> Data Import -> click on Import from Dump Project folder -> then choose the downloded and extracted folder -> below Select Database Objects to Import (only available for Project folders) have to select checkbox select all tables right side ->
below choose drop down option is Dump DataStructure and Data -> finally click on Start Import .
then it will imports all the database and table .
in jdbc all class of  DaoImpl package maintain data base connectivity of your database username : root and password :root or if your data base username and password is different then change the username and password.
